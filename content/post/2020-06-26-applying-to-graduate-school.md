I applied to 12 Political Science Ph.D. programs during my senior year as an undergraduate student, most of them in the Midwest, and I got accepted to 7 of them. This process, especially as a first-generation college student, was challenging for me. Fortunately, I had great mentors in the process[^thanks]. I wanted to take this opportunity to discuss some of the experiences that I had, things that worked for me, and opportunities that aspiring graduate students can take advantage of in their journeys.
