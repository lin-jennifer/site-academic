Hello! My name is Jennifer Lin. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Department of Political Science at Northwestern University. My research focus is in American Politics, with a specific interest in affective polarization, morality, social networks, political geography, socialization, public opinion and political behaviors.

In my research, I like to apply a variety of survey, experiment and computational social science methods to answer my questions. Such computational tools include text as data, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R, network analysis and machine learning. You can view my publications [here](https://lin-jennifer.github.io/writing/)

My dissertation focuses on military political socialization,. I compare the experiences and outcomes of college students who attend civilian colleges without Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) participation, ROTC students and cadets at the various military academies. I look forward to sharing more about my dissertation as it develops.

In addition, I teach a variety of courses, mostly on political methodology. To date, I have taught R and statistical methods to undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University, along with MBA students at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management. I have also led a variety of workshops on various computing topics, including:

- Beginner and Advanced Graphics in R
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in R
- R Syntax and Functions
- Data Wrangling with Tidyverse
- Introduction to Markdown, $\LaTeX$, and GitHub
