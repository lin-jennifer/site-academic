abstract: The influence of religion is embedded deeply in the soil of American political culture. The majority of Americans go to church and affiliate with some type of faith throughout their lives. Recently, there is also a rise in the use of churches as polling locations. While the intention is not to mix the notions of church and state, this raises the question of potential influences of religion on political behavior. In this research project, I aim to understand if priming of religion, as exemplified by voting in a church, would lead to more conservative voting behaviors. Through a survey design with 304 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, this research primes participants to think about religion and asks them to rate their agreement with a vignette that presents an argument on abortion. The results suggest that the argument was more impactful in swaying peopleâ€™s decisions, and not the religious prime itself. A possible reason for this is the saliency of the prime. As the prime was not as salient as voting in a church, this may not create the effect that the study aimed to test. For further research, it is useful to make more salient primes as a way to test the interaction of religion and conservative political behavior.
