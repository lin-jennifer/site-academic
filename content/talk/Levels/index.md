abstract: In this paper, we draw on a classic typology of political sophistication — the levels of conceptualization typology from The American Voter — to understand whether citizens correctly perceive the way their friends and peers think about politics. Unlike previous studies, which have used this typology in a way such that researchers categorize survey research respondents, we use this typology to ascertain how citizens view each other—and whether it matters. Using a deliberation experiment, we ask subjects to perform a task that traditionally has been performed by scholars$:$ classifying discussion partners in terms of the way they conceptualize politics. Drawing on these results, we ask several questions. First, how strong a correspondence is there between expert classifications and peer classifications? In other words, can subjects, even after brief discussions with strangers, accurately assess the way co-discussants talk about politics? Second, is there a relationship between how people think about politics and whether they are perceived as possessing expertise? Finally, how does the levels of conceptualization typology line up with other measures of sophistication and knowledge typically probed in studies of discussion partner expertise?
