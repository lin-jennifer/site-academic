*The poster template is based off the [UW--Madison Poster](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/uw-madison-poster-template/tfbyxyhbymsq) on Overleaf.*

## Demo

The outcome of the poster can be seen here: https://github.com/lin-jennifer/NCFPoster/blob/master/main.pdf

## Using this Template

The best way to use this template is to clone the GitHub repositiory in the link at the top of the post or [here](https://github.com/lin-jennifer/NCFPoster)

If you choose to delete some of the demo objects in the file in favor of your own materials, be sure to include the following items

1. `main.tex`: The root file that contains the temaplate for the poster seen in the demo. You can rename this to be whatever you like.
2. `ncftheme.sty`: Contains the code for the colors and the design that the poster needs
3. `Images/`: This serves as the established graphics path and contains the New College logo for the top of the poster.
