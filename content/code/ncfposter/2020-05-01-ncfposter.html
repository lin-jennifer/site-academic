<h2>Using this Template</h2>
<p>The best way to use this template is to clone the GitHub repositiory in the link at the top of the post or <a href="https://github.com/lin-jennifer/NCFPoster">here</a></p>
<p>If you choose to delete some of the demo objects in the file in favor of your own materials, be sure to include the following items</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>main.tex</code>: The root file that contains the temaplate for the poster seen in the demo. You can rename this to be whatever you like.</li>
<li><code>ncftheme.sty</code>: Contains the code for the colors and the design that the poster needs</li>
<li><code>Images/</code>: This serves as the established graphics path and contains the New College logo for the top of the poster.</li>
</ol>
