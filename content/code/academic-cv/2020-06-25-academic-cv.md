*This template was made as a combination of [Vuong V. Trinh's CV](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/vuong-v-trinhs-cv/rwjrnbbbtgdy) and [Trey Hunner's Resume](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume) while integrating additional bonus features*

Like my [CV](https://lin-jennifer.github.io/files/CV.pdf)? I created this style based on the aforementioned inspirations so that my CV can be more organized with sections and subsections.

## Demo

For a demo of the template, see my [CV](https://lin-jennifer.github.io/files/CV.pdf) tab in the menu bar or consult the output from the published template below.

## Using This Template

To access this template, clone my [LaTeX Templates GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lin-jennifer/LaTeXTemplates) and extract the CV folder. 

There are three main files

1. `CV.tex` -- This is the main file where you write your CV contents.
2. `CV.cls` -- This is the class file that contains information about the parameters of the file
3. `head.tex` -- This is the heading file that contains what would normally go before the `\begin{document}` command -- new commands, packages and others

## Features

1. **Table of Contents** -- When using Adobe reader for PDFs, the section and subsection headers are labeled and thus can appear on the left-hand panel for easy cross-reference
2. **Section Headings** -- These follow the style in [Trey Hunner's Resume](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume) containing the title of the section followed by a line spanning the entire width of the page.
3. **Subsection Headings** -- These follow the style of the two-column style CVs such as [Vuong V. Trinh's CV](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/vuong-v-trinhs-cv/rwjrnbbbtgdy) such that the heading is on the left and the main text is on the right.
