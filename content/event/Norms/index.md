abstract: The Focus Theory of Normative Conduct states that social norms, when made salient to individuals, results in norm-conforming behavior. The focus of this study is on the causal link between descriptive peer norms and intergroup attitudes and intentions. For this project, we compared a negative descriptive norm about a high prevalence of discriminatory behavior among peers to a positive descriptive norm of pro-diversity attitudes among peers (a control condition is also included). The study recruited participants (n = 89) from Amazon Mechanical Turk where each participant was paid \$0.40 for their participation. Participants were asked to complete two separate surveys. The first survey made salient the descriptive social norms for either the negative descriptive norms condition, positive descriptive norms condition, or the control condition using a data interpretation activity. The second survey consisted of four self-report Likert scale items that measured intergroup anxiety, concern about discrimination, tolerance of racism, and behavioral intentions. This survey also included a manipulation check that measured perceptions of peer norms regarding discrimination and inclusivity. To assess whether participants were engaged in the data interpretation activity, content analyses on the responses to the interpretation questions were conducted. Linear models were constructed in R to assess the relationship between norm condition and each of the outcome measures. The results show that while most individuals do engage in the data interpretation task and demonstrate an understanding of the normative information that the data imply, there was no influence of the descriptive peer norms information on norm-conforming intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions.
