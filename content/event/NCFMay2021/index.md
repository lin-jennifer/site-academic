abstract: From an abrupt transition to a work and learn from home lifestyle, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how we live and experience the world. To understand the various attitudes and behaviors in response to the pandemic but also to the protests for racial justice and the 2020 presidential election, the COVID States Project conducted monthly surveys since April 2020 in each state in the nation. Each survey samples respondents (n = 20,000-25,000) from each state and contains an assortment of questions related to the pandemic and current events. These include attitudes towards policies curbing the spread of the pandemic, experiences with distance learning, mental health, voting in the 2020 presidential election, perceptions of the January 6 capitol riots, vaccine attitudes, and many other topics. This presentation will provide an overview of the project, and a summary of key findings. Here, we will explore vaccine attitudes among Americans along with other experiences during the pandemic including mental health and education. We will also examine attitudes towards various political events including the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 capitol riots.
