## Section Overview

[Full Syllabus (PDF)](https://lin-jennifer.github.io/teaching/syllabus/Syllabus_PS210Section.pdf)

Each week, we will meet for an hour outside the lecture times to discuss the course materials. This is your opportunity to ask questions, review the material and clarify anything that can be confusing from the course. 

- Come to section prepared to discuss the materials from the readings and lectures. I will briefly review the lecture material for the week during each section. However, the emphasis will be on your questions. 
- Please be respectful of others when speaking, listening and responding. 
- Please try to check your emails and Canvas at least once daily for any course readings and updates from Dr. Seawright, myself or any of the other course TAs.

Your attendance at these TA sections are part of your participation grade. I will be taking attendance each time we meet.

If you have any questions at any point in this course, please do not hesitate to email me. If you would like to speak to me and cannot make my office hours, I am happy to set up an appointment to meet. Please note that if you email me after 7 PM Central Time on the weekday or at any point during the weekend, I may not respond to your question until the next business day. If I can be of assistance in any way to you in this class, please do not hesitate to reach out.
