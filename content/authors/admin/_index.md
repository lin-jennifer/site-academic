I am a Ph.D. Student in Political Science at Northwestern University. I study American politics, specifically focused in political psychology, political behavior and public opinion. I also study political methodology with a focus on experiments, surveys and quantitative research methods.

I am a member of the [Political Science Research Lab](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~jnd260/lab.html) directed by Dr. James N. Druckman.
