# `site-academic`: The Source Repository for http://lin-jennifer.github.io 

## Building the site

**Automatically**: Run `update.sh`

**By Hand**:

Method 1: Run the `server site` under the blogdown admin menu in R Studio.

Method 2: If that fails, run `build-site.R`

Either way: PUSH `lin-jennifer.github.io` to the master branch

*It is recommended that you try all three methods at least once because we don't know for sure yet which one will work 100% of the time.*
